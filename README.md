## Overview

An interactive financial dashboard that combines VIX and CNN Fear & Greed Index into a single **Composite Panic Index** to identify buy/sell opportunities in tech and semiconductor ETFs. The dashboard covers a full market cycle from May 2021 to April 2026, including the 2022 bear market, 2023–2024 AI bull run, and 2025 tariff shock.

**Key Finding**: The Panic Index is asymmetric — buy signals (extreme panic) are statistically validated with 64–74% win rates across 1-week to 3-month horizons, while sell signals (extreme greed) are less reliable in sustained bull markets.

## Composite Panic Index

```
vix_norm    = (VIX - VIX_min) / (VIX_max - VIX_min) × 100
fg_fear     = 100 - Fear_Greed_Score
panic_index = vix_norm × 0.5 + fg_fear × 0.5
```

|--------|-----------|-------|
| Buy Zone | Panic Index > 64 | 95th percentile of 5-year history |
| Sell Zone | Panic Index < 15 | 5th percentile of 5-year history |

## Key Results (Full Period: May 2021 – Apr 2026)

## Key Results

**Price Signal Map:**
- Buy signals (Panic Index > 64) cluster around major market bottoms: 2022 bear market, 2025 tariff shock.
- Sell signals (Panic Index < 15) appear during sustained greed periods in 2023–2024 bull market.

**Forward Return Analysis (full 5-year period):**
- Extreme panic signals: win rates **64–74%** across 1-week to 3-month horizons ✅
- Extreme greed signals: prices continued rising after signals ❌
- **The Panic Index is asymmetric — buy signals validated, sell signals are not.**

**Backtest vs Buy & Hold:**
- Strategy reduces maximum drawdown by ~56% (-15% vs -35%)
- Buy & Hold outperforms on absolute return in this bull market period
- Strategy is more suitable for **risk-averse investors** who prioritize capital preservation

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Day-ahead predictive correlation near zero — consistent with Efficient Market Hypothesis
- Medium-term regime identification (1-week to 3-month) shows significant signal effectiveness
